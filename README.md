# Cybersecurity-Graph-RAG
This project aims to advance cybersecurity knowledge dissemination, visualization, and analysis of threat actor relationships in China. It introduces multiple innovations beyond existing research and tools.

The knowledge graph platform uniquely integrates three core cybersecurity domains: software vulnerabilities, attack group alerts, and APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) organization profiles—ensuring comprehensive coverage. It supports both direct and multi-hop searches, enhanced by real-time query suggestions, fuzzy matching, and personalized recommendations to deepen user exploration. Built with a modular architecture—decoupling front-end, back-end, and database—the system is designed for maintainability and future scalability. Additional features include interactive statistical visualizations and keyword-based tracking of APT activities.

A key technical innovation lies in the search algorithm. While leveraging state-of-the-art Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the project tailors the pipeline specifically for Neo4j graph databases. This adaptation enables large language models to effectively retrieve and reason over graph-structured data. The optimized workflow dramatically reduces token usage and improves search efficiency, while preserving both breadth (coverage of relevant nodes) and depth (multi-hop reasoning) in responses. As a result, the system delivers accurate, context-aware answers with strong inferential capabilities—bridging the gap between unstructured natural language queries and structured cyber threat intelligence.

Overall, the platform not only consolidates fragmented cybersecurity knowledge into a unified, searchable graph but also pioneers an efficient, graph-native RAG framework that sets a new standard for domain-specific QA systems in threat intelligence.
