::SKILL:To input faked entries into Web logs:LEVEL:Low::
::SKILL:XPath Injection shares the same basic premises with SQL Injection. An attacker must have knowledge of XPath syntax and constructs in order to successfully leverage XPath Injection:LEVEL:Low::
::SKILL:Basic understanding of XQuery:LEVEL:Low::
::SKILL:To land and launch a script on victim's machine with appropriate footprinting logic for enumerating services and vulnerabilities in JavaScript:LEVEL:Medium::
::SKILL:To achieve a redirection and use of less trusted source, an attacker can simply edit HTTP Headers that are sent to client machine.:LEVEL:Low::SKILL:Exploiting a client side vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into the browser's executable process.:LEVEL:High::
::SKILL:Forcibly browseable pages can be discovered by using a number of automated tools. Doing the same manually is tedious but by no means difficult.:LEVEL:Low::
::SKILL:The attacker needs to have knowledge of not only the application to exploit but also the exact nature of commands that pertain to the target operating system. This may involve, though not always, knowledge of specific assembly commands for the platform.:LEVEL:High::
::SKILL:The attacker needs to be able to poison the resolver - DNS entries or local hosts file or router entry pointing to a trusted DNS server - in order to successfully carry out a pharming attack. Setting up a fake website, identical to the targeted one, does not require special skills.:LEVEL:Medium::
::SKILL:The attacker needs to have knowledge of observing the protocol exchange and managing the required connections in order to issue and respond to challenges:LEVEL:Medium::
::SKILL:An attacker can simply overflow an integer by inserting an out of range value.:LEVEL:Low::SKILL:Exploiting a buffer overflow by injecting malicious code into the stack of a software system or even the heap can require a higher skill level.:LEVEL:High::
::SKILL:This attack can be as simple as adding extra characters to the logged data (e.g. username). Adding entries is typically easier than removing entries.:LEVEL:Low::SKILL:A more sophisticated attack can try to defeat the input validation mechanism.:LEVEL:Medium::
::SKILL:This attack can get sophisticated since the attack may use cryptography.:LEVEL:Medium::
::SKILL:This attack can be as simple as reading WSDL and starting sending invalid request.:LEVEL:Low::SKILL:This attack can be used to perform more sophisticated attacks (SQL injection, etc.):LEVEL:Medium::
::SKILL:Knowledge of how to block access to libraries, as well as knowledge of how to leverage the resulting state of the application based on the failed call.:LEVEL:Low::
::SKILL:Cryptanalysis generally requires a very significant level of understanding of mathematics and computation.:LEVEL:High::
::SKILL:Basic knowledge about websites: obtaining them, designing and implementing them, etc.:LEVEL:Medium::
::SKILL:Denial of service (making the parser crash):LEVEL:Low::SKILL:Arbitrary code execution:LEVEL:High::
