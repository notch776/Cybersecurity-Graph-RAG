Read Data:NOTE:Confidentiality Read Data In most cases, if cryptanalysis is successful at all, an adversary will not be able to decrypt the entire message, but instead will only be able to deduce some information about the plaintext. However, that may be sufficient for an adversary, depending on the context of the attack.::
